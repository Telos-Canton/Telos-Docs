This is to explain why you need to vote for 30 BPs. Telos adopts the "Inverse Vote Weighting" rule, which means that if you only vote for 1 or 2 block producers, then your voting weight The voting weight will be lower than voting for the 30 block producers. The goal is to encourage most Telos members to learn more about block producer candidates and to fight against those who vote only for themselves and their connected BPs.

The main point is, if the number of BP voted is less than 30, the voting power will be greatly reduced, so please try to vote for 30 BPs.

2. Click on "Submit Votes" to complete the vote.

Isn’t that a piece of cake?

Fun fact: the Telos Mainnet will not be fully activated until it produces one million blocks.  
By lanuch time UTC 07:40 December 13, 2018, the number of blocks produced at the on the Mainnet is 5594.  
If one block takes 0.5 seconds to produced, the Mainnet will be activated after 135-150 hours (about 5.5-6 days), which is around December 18 - 19.   
Redemption and transfer operations can only start after the activation of the Mainnet. So, whatever operations you wish to do after the activation, please remember to vote during these few days. And it is also fun to get to know more about the BP candidates. Telos thank you for your support!

Finally, please vote for Telos Canton (BP name: teloscantons).   
We adhere to independence and the "fair, just, open" principle of Telos Canton.   
Thank you again for your support!
